# First Homework

## Problem 1

### Goal

Do Face completion on data with missing entries, visualize mean face and eigenfaces, show reconstruction errors using Frobenius norm.

### Results

After reconstructing the images, and visually inspecting them, we saw that the algorithm works.
Also by looking at mean faces of each reconstructed data matrix and its eigenvectors we see that reconstructing
algorithm does a good job and eigenvectors still capture variance in lightning and small movements of face due to
the fact the person moved a little during caputring of images.

The computational trick from original Eigenfaces paper was used to speed up the computation of eigenfaces, otherwise the problem
is intractable.

To run code just `Exercise_1.m` while bein in the hw_1 directory.

### Errors

0.1: 3.2589+09
0.2: 3.2614e+09
0.3: 3.2681e+09
0.4: 3.2922e+09 


## Problem 2

### Goal

Implement Hough transform for searching lines in images.

### Solution

For the last part where it was needed to find the begining of the line segment and the end a simple algo was used:
first the equation of the line was taken and the respective coordinates of thresholded image with magnitudes of
gradient was used. The algorithm walks along the line and when it finds non-zero element it marks this part as a start
of line segment. Then it continues to walk until the zero element is reached. After this the line segment is saved.

The following constants was used:

```
AMOUNT_OF_BINS_THETA = 50
AMOUNT_OF_BINS_RO = 100
```

`500` the magnitude threshold.
`900` hough threshold.
The voting was simply implemented by doing counts.
