# First Homework

## Problem 1

### Goal

Do Face completion on data with missing entries, visualize mean face and eigenfaces, show reconstruction errors using Frobenius norm.

### Results

After reconstructing the images, and visually inspecting them, we saw that the algorithm works.
Also by looking at mean faces of each reconstructed data matrix and its eigenvectors we see that reconstructing
algorithm does a good job and eigenvectors still capture variance in lightning and small movements of face due to
the fact the person moved a little during caputring of images.

The computational trick from original Eigenfaces paper was used to speed up the computation of eigenfaces, otherwise the problem
is intractable.

To run code just `Exercise_1.m` while bein in the hw_1 directory.
